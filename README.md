### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**johnm2102/johnm2102** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some end-of-year projects, but once they are done I can hopefully start on some cool things
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Randomized Algorithms, Data Science and a little bit about Algorithms and Datastructure
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm trying not to lose my mind :)
